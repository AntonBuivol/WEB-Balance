**Team(Martin Nõmmiste, Anton Buivol, Maksym Miskevych)**
## 1. link to the site [Web-balance](https://antonbuivol22.thkit.ee/WEB-Balance/WEB-balance-main/index.php)
## 2. [Technical documentation]([https://github.com/AntonBuivol/WEB-Balance/tree/Martin](https://github.com/AntonBuivol/WEB-Balance/blob/Martin/WEB-balance-main/README.md)) link to work with the attached Readme (technical documentation) file, which describes the project and how we did it
## 3. added jira tasks, who did what and also added descriptions for each task in detail ![pilt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8d35668-063a-452d-9857-8c315900a78e) 

## 4. [testing](https://github.com/AntonBuivol/WEB-Balance/tree/Martin/sitetesting)  We added testing so that a user would enter, 5 products would be randomly added to the cart and paid for, we also added a readme where all the tests and their descriptions are described
## 5. development process 
### 1. Idea and Requirements Analysis
* Collecting ideas from the team and users: At this stage, it is important to gather opinions from both our team
and users to understand which features they consider important and useful for our product.
* Defining business goals and feature value: We analyze how the new feature will help achieve business objectives,
such as improving user experience or increasing sales.
### 2. Technical Analysis and Assessment
* Developing technical requirements: Here, I need to define which technologies and tools will be used for
implementing the feature and what tasks need to be solved from a technical perspective.
* Estimating effort and time for task completion: I estimate how much time we need to implement the feature and
which stages of development need to be prioritized.
### 3. Design and Prototyping
* Developing UI/UX design, mockups, and prototypes: It's important to think about how the feature will look from
a user’s perspective. I participate in developing interface mockups and prototypes.
* Prototyping and user testing: Based on the prototype, we test the interface with users to understand how
comfortable they are interacting with the new features.
### 4. Planning and Prioritization
* Breaking down the feature into subtasks: We break the feature into smaller parts
so that each team can focus on completing their specific task.
* Defining task priorities: We determine which tasks are more important for
implementing the feature and when they need to be completed to stay on track.
### 5. Development
* Writing and testing code: At this stage, I write the code that implements the new
feature and immediately test it to ensure it works correctly.
* Adhering to coding standards and team conventions: I follow common coding
standards to ensure the code is clear for other developers and easy to maintain in
the future.
### 6. Testing
* Writing unit and integration tests: I create tests for individual parts of the code to
make sure everything works correctly and test how they interact with each other.
* Performance and security testing: We check how the new feature impacts the
system's performance and ensure it is secure for users.
### 7. Code Review
* Conducting code reviews within the team: I show my code to my colleagues for
feedback on errors and improvements to ensure the feature works as expected.
* Addressing colleagues' comments and improving the feature: I make changes to
the code based on feedback from colleagues to enhance the solution’s quality.
### 8. Documentation
* Writing technical documentation for the development team: I describe how the
feature was implemented, which technologies were used, and how it works so that
other developers can understand what was done.
* Updating user documentation: I update guides and FAQs for users so they can
quickly understand how to use the new feature.
### 9. Pre-release Testing (on staging)
* Testing on staging server: I test the feature on a server that closely mirrors the
production environment to ensure everything works correctly before the release.
* Smoke testing and UAT: We perform basic functionality testing and test it with users
to confirm the feature is ready for use.
### 10. Release
* Preparing the release version: I participate in preparing the final version of the
feature for release, checking that everything is ready for deployment.
* Updating and deploying to production: After verification, I help deploy the feature
to the live server so that users can start using it.
### 11. Monitoring and Support
* Monitoring performance metrics and logs: After release, I keep track of system
metrics to ensure the new feature doesn’t cause any performance issues.
* Collecting feedback from users: I gather user feedback about the new feature to
quickly identify any issues and improve functionality.
### 12. Retrospective
* Analyzing the work done: We, as a team, discuss how the development process
went, what worked well, and what could have been done better.
* Discussing the experience gained during the feature implementation: I draw
conclusions from the development experience to improve processes in the future.
